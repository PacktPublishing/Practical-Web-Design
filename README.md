# Practical Web Design
This is the code repository for [Practical Web Design](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/practical-web-design?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788395038), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Practical Web Design is a complete hands-on book of Web designer. Every chapter has been thoroughly revised to deliver information, tips, and approaches that are easy to understand and simple to use. 

The first part of this book is about the fundamentals of web design. It focuses on its history, evolution, and also the principal components. We will finish this book with a step-by-step design workflow and a comparison between Responsive design and Adaptive design.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<html> <!--This is our HTML main tag-->
 <head> <!--This is our head tag where we put our title and script and all infos relative to our page.-->
  <title>My Page Title</title>
 </head>
 <body> <!--This is where all our content will go-->
  <h1>John Doe</h1>

 </body>
</html>
```

To get the most out of this book, it's best to have a bit of design experience, but it's not necessary. You can go through this course without any knowledge whatsoever.
Furthermore, you'll need a computer running on Windows, or OS X; the latest version of your favorite internet browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari); and a code editor, in this book, we'll use Atom.
